# Intelligent Package Management Platform

## Objective

Modern products often come with one or more packaging layers that serve various purposes such as transportation, protection, conservation, and information dissemination. With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0, these packages have evolved into "intelligent" entities capable of acquiring, processing, and transmitting data, including information about their content and surrounding environment.

The significant amount of data produced by these intelligent packages poses challenges in terms of understanding, monitoring, and taking action. This project aims to develop an enterprise application for manufacturers, logistics operators, and end consumers to track and monitor data from intelligent packaging.

## Features

### Manufacturer

- Quality Control: Monitor environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity) during transportation to identify deviations from quality standards.
- Consumer Consumption: Track the consumption of specific packaged products to make decisions about reordering.

### Logistics Operator

- Location Tracking: Real-time location and tracking data for optimizing routes and ensuring timely deliveries.
- Environmental Conditions: Data on temperature, humidity, accelerations, and other environmental factors during transportation to handle products according to specifications.
- Security Alerts: Detection of package opening and unauthorized access alerts for ensuring safety and integrity during transport.

### End Consumer

- Delivery Updates: Real-time delivery data, including estimated delivery times, package location, and notifications during delivery.
- Quality Information: Data related to environmental conditions during transport and overall product quality to assure consumers of product integrity.
- Security Alerts: Security data, such as detection of package opening and unauthorized access, to assure consumers that the product has not been tampered with before delivery.
- Consumer Consumption: Data on the consumption of specific packaged products (e.g., ink levels in printer cartridges) to decide on reordering.

## Application Functionality

The application provides general functionalities for managing packaging (CRUD) and associated attributes. Packaging attributes include ID, packaging type (primary, secondary, tertiary), packaging material, packaged product, and a set of values observed by the packaging. For shipping, transporting, and delivering product orders, an additional transport packaging can be registered and tracked.

The application should support CRUD operations for orders and products, including actions such as ordering and returning by end consumers.

## Additional Functionality

- Data Import: Import data through Comma Separated Values (CSV), Excel, or API (e.g., product listings, packaging, orders, sensor data).
- Mobile Application: Develop a mobile application for end consumers.
- Responsive Themes: Responsive design adapted to screens of different dimensions (tablet, smartphone, PC monitor).
- Internal Messaging/Notifications System.

## Technological Requirements

1. The application should support communication between the business logic layer and client applications through web service-based interfaces.
2. The implementation should be based on Jakarta Enterprise Edition technologies for business logic and data access layers. Frontend technology such as Vue.js/NUXT may be used for the presentation layer.
3. Adoption of architectural standards promoting modularity in each layer of the application (e.g., MVC, domain model, ORM techniques for data persistence, lazy loading, concurrency control, etc.).
4. Use relational database engines with GPL or LGPL licenses for data persistence (free or open-source software).

## Note

The project's value will increase with detailed specifications and additional functionalities that arise from relevant questions posed to the application's "client."
